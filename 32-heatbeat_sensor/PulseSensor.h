 * Class for interfacing with a http://pulsesensor.myshopify.com/ 'Pulse Sensor Amped'.
 * The contents of this class are based on the "Pulse Sensor Amped 1.1" Arduino Sketch.
 *
 * When using this class for the first time, it is recommended that you use the Processing 
 * GUI app available http://pulsesensor.myshopify.com/pages/code-and-guide. Using this, you
 * will easily be able to verify the operating of your sensor, and the integration of this
 * class into your mbed project.
